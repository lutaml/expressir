== Purpose

Expressir ("`EXPRESS in Ruby`") is a Ruby parser for EXPRESS and
a set of Ruby tools for accessing ISO EXPRESS data models.

== Architecture

Expressir consists of 3 parts:

. Parsers. A parser allows Expressir to read EXPRESS files, including:

** EXPRESS data modelling language (ISO 10303-11:2007)
** EXPRESS data modelling language in XML (STEPmod)
** EXPRESS XML (ISO 10303-28:2007)
"`Industrial automation systems and integration — Product data representation and exchange — Part 28: Implementation methods: XML representations of EXPRESS schemas and data, using XML schemas`")

. Data model. The data model (`lib/expressir/express`) is the Ruby data model that fully represents an EXPRESS data model.

. Converters. A converter transforms the EXPRESS Ruby data model into an interoperable export format, including:
** EXPRESS data modelling language (ISO 10303-11:2007)
** W3C OWL
** OMG SysML (XMI 2.1, XMI 2.5)
** OMG UML 2 (XMI 2.1)
** OMG UML 2 for Eclipse (XMI 2.1)


== Usage

This gem ships with a CLI tool. To check what's available you can simply run
the script directly from `exe/expressir`, by default it will display some usage
instructions.

[source, sh]
----
$ expressir

Commands:
  expressir format PATH     # pretty print EXPRESS schema located at PATH
  expressir help [COMMAND]  # Describe available commands or one specific command
  expressir version         # The Expressir Version
----

=== Pretty print

[source, sh]
----
expressir format schemas/resources/action_schema/action_schema.exp
----


== Development

We are following Sandi Metz's Rules for this gem, you can read
the http://robots.thoughtbot.com/post/50655960596/sandi-metz-rules-for-developers[description of the rules here] All new code should follow these rules.
If you make changes in a pre-existing file that violates these rules you should
fix the violations as part of your contribution.

=== Setup

Clone the repository.

[source, sh]
----
git clone https://github.com/metanorma/expressir
----

Setup your environment.

[source, sh]
----
bin/setup
git submodule update --init
bundle exec rake generate
bundle exec rake compile
----

Run the test suite

[source, sh]
----
bundle exec rake
----

=== Grammar updates

THe EXPRESS grammar is lined as Git submodule at `ext/express-grammar`.

Should you update it, please run `rake generate`. This command will generate
source code for updated native extension using the `antlr4-native` gem. Please
note that we create several classes on top of `antlr4-native` output so using
embedded rake task is a real requirement.

When a new extension is generated and tested, please check in updated C++ files
to git (`rake generate` is NOT a CI step, extension source files are pulled from
the repo).
