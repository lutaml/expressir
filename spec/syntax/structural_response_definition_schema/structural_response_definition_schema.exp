(*"structural_response_definition_schema"

The subject of the *structural_response_definition_schema* is the definitional aspects of a finite element analysis model that describe the structural response of a product.

*)

(*"structural_response_definition_schema.__fund_cons"

The definitional aspects of a finite element model are related to the representational aspects that they describe by a *property_definition_representation* association to a <<express:structural_response_definition_schema.structural_response_property,structural_response_property>>. This relationship is enforced by the rules in the *structural_response_property_definition_representation* entity in the *structural_response_representation_schema*.

NOTE: The relationships of the definitional and representational aspects of the FEA information model, which are established by the property_definition_representation and <<express:structural_response_definition_schema.structural_response_property,structural_response_property>> entities, are shown in <<fig-fea-information-model-high-level>>.

*)

(*"structural_response_definition_schema.structural_response_property"

A <<express:structural_response_definition_schema.structural_response_property,structural_response_property>> relates the response of a finite element model representation of a product to the properties characterizing the product.
