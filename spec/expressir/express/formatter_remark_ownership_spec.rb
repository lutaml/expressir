# Where each remark ends up, as opposed to whether it survives.
#
# A remark can come through a round trip intact and still be wrong. On main,
# two remarks in `function_body_remarks.exp` escape a REPEAT loop and reattach
# to the enclosing statement and function: the text is present, spelled the
# same, and counted, so the conservation spec passes them. This one does not.
#
# Tagged remarks are traced too. They live in a plain string collection on
# the element they bind to rather than in the RemarkInfo list, and reading
# only the latter made this spec pass `remark.exp` while examining none of
# its remarks. That fixture holds 133 tagged tail remarks and one tagged
# embedded remark, hence 134.
#
# The only move allowed is the documented schema-level gap, where a remark
# between declarations is written outside its SCHEMA and a reparse attaches it
# to the file. `escapes` is pinned per fixture so that gap cannot widen, and
# the shape is checked so a remark leaving any other construct fails.
#
# `traced` and `tagged` are floors, not snapshots, and they exist for a
# different reason: an ownership check that reads no remarks passes every
# fixture. That is exactly how the tagged-remark blind spot went unnoticed,
# `remark.exp` reporting no moves while none of its remarks were read.
# Adding a comment to a shared fixture should not fail these; losing coverage
# should.
