reeper is a set of Ruby tools for harvesting ISO EXPRESS data models.

The various mapping files are versioned independently of the reeper.rb file.

The tools have been tested on Ubuntu Linux, Windows XP and OS X and so are compatible with
multiple versions of Ruby.

The input format for the tool is an XML format that is based on the standard EXPRESS DTD.
The freely available Eurostep eep parser (http://www.eurostep.com) can produce this format.
