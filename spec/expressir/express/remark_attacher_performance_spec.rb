  # Remark attachment answers per-remark questions from whole-source scans.
  # Every such scan MUST be built once per source and reused. Rebuilding one
  # per remark is quadratic in (lines x remarks): it is invisible on small
  # fixtures, and on a comment-dense schema it has cost 90x the whole parse.
  #
  # These examples assert the invariant — how many times the shared structure
  # is built — rather than wall-clock time, so they cannot flake on a slow CI
  # runner while still catching the regression exactly.
